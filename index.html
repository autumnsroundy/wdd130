                <P>
                Hello! My name is Autumn Roundy and I am from New Mexico. I grew up in southern New Mexico where 
                green chili was our staple food item. I loved living the the southwest, but moved up north to 
                Meridian, ID after venturing through some of my college career. I have my associate's degree
                in photographic communications where I photographed wildlife in Yellowstone National Park for a year. 
                I am currently living this summer in Ketchikan, AK where I help run tour boats to private island
                trails in the Tongass National Forest. I continue photographing the wildlife here in Alaska and go
                on many excursions in my off time. I am so thrilled to be in Web Development and plan on making
                a long term career in this industy.
                </P>

                <p>Alaska is home to many vast landscapes that inhabit thousands of varying wildlife species in the Pacific
                Northwest region of the United States. Outdoor adventures are in every corner of Alaska, from roaring seas to 
                thick rainforest, to the tundra regions of northern territories, Alaska has it all. Although there are relatively
                 few residents, Alaska is a desired location for many travelers across the world. Alaska's beauty and possibilites 
                 of exploration are endless.
